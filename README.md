# RestService

Basic and **very** simple rest service for displaying `CS2` skins (or stickers) and basic decription about them.

# Usage

To start the project run:
```
mix run --no-halt
```

## API:

Endpoints work on `http://localhost:4000` by default

Exposed endpoints:

### GET: /home

This endpoint returns html of home page to select skins/stickers you would like to see

### GET: /v1/stickers/{from}/{to}

Display stickers and basic information about themselves:

- `return type`: text/html
- `from`: integer between 0 and 7984
- `to`: integer between 0 and 7984, larger then `from`

### GET: /v1/weapons/{weapon-type}/{num}

Display specific weapon type skins and basic information about them:

- `return type`: text/html
- `weapon-type`: String from `weapon-types` list (given below)
- `num`: Positive integer or literal `all`

### Why?

This was just a simple and dirty way to learn about `plug`, `tesla`, `jason` and mix in general. I always wanted to do something Ã  la *steam market+*. Unfortunately, every api that I could find for market pursposes is not free, and I am not paying 20$/month for this. So instead I did

Other important reason why I did it like I did was to do RESTful API as close to the ground I wanted to. This was just for getting better understanding of this (and mix in general)
